# THIZ
THIZ is a tabletop game inspired by the system ZeFRS. It attempts to be setting-agnostic while providing the players and the referee to play truly epic heroes. Characters are intended to be in the same vein as those in a Swords 'n Sorcery world, where they they can be powerful in a cinematic sense yet still face challenging adversaries. Magic is also intended to be less restrictive and more varied than in ZeFRS. 

The rules are nearing completion, and anyone wishing to use or adapt these rules may do so as they see fit. The only thing I require is that you maintain the same credits contained in the credits page of the pdf. If anyone has any suggestions, please feel free to make them.
