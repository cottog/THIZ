# THIZ
THIZ is a tabletop game inspired by the system ZeFRS. It attempts to be setting-agnostic while providing the players and the referee to play truly epic heroes. Characters are intended to be in the same vein as those in a Swords 'n Sorcery world, where they they can be powerful in a cinematic sense yet still face challenging adversaries. Characters are class-free, and their abilities are instead defined by their ratings in various Skills. Many Skills have a place in all settings, but more Skills can be added to the game in order to make suit gameplay to any setting and style of play. Magic is intended to be less restrictive and more varied than in ZeFRS, and there is an additional level of character customization through Quirks.  

The main drawback of this system is that more than usual is left to the referee's discretion. Many tables, however, may see this as a chance for collaboration between the players and referee and an allowance for logic and intuition to take precedence over blind adherence to a system of rules, rather than something detrimental.

The rules are nearing completion, and anyone wishing to use or adapt these rules may do so as they see fit. The only thing I require is that you maintain the same credits contained in the credits page of the pdf. If anyone has any suggestions, please feel free to make them.
