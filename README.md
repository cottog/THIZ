# THIZ
THIZ is a tabletop game inspired by the system ZeFRS. It attempts to be setting-agnostic while providing the players and the referee a means to play truly epic heroes. Characters are intended to be in the same vein as those in a Sword & Sorcery world, where they they can be powerful in a cinematic sense yet still face challenging adversaries. Characters are class-free, and their abilities are instead defined by their ratings in various Skills. Many Skills included in the rulebook have a place in all settings, but more Skills can be added to the game in order to suit any setting or style of play. Magic is intended to be less restrictive and more varied than in ZeFRS, and there is an additional level of character customization through Quirks.  

The main drawback of this system is that more than usual is left to the referee's discretion. Many tables, however, may see this as a chance for collaboration between the players and referee and an allowance for logic and intuition to take precedence over blind adherence to a system of rules, rather than something detrimental.

The rules are essentially complete. I just need to add my mass combat rules, but those are fairly complex and that might take a while. The system is finished to the point that everyday use (outside of mass combat) is definitely possible. The rulebook doesn't have a bestiary at the moment, but potential referees should just keep in mind that every character is a collection of Skills. A zero in a skill is average human aptitude, whereas a 7 represents expert knowledge or performance in that skill's domain. 30 represents the peak of human performance in that skill, and is the highest possible rating for a human character in a skill. A referee could add new races by giving them different starting values or bonuses to skills known. 


#License Stuff
Anyone wishing to use or adapt these rules may do so as they see fit. The only thing I require is that you maintain the same credits page as in the pdf. I don't mind if I don't get any mention, but Zeb and the ZeFRS crew deserves some mention.
